# ðŸŽ¥ CINEMA BOOKING WINDOWS APP

This is a cinema booking application I created for my ICS2O class. 

## how to use

You must first login. Then, you are presented with 8 movies, which you can group by category (comedy, action...) After you pick a movie, you pick the time and location of the theatre. You then pick the food combo you want and head to checkout. At checkout, you press calculate to see the total charges and after "paying", you get a receipt, which you present at the theatre.
